# CLIDice
A Command-Line Dice Roller using Python 3.10

A simple tool to roll dice, digitally. Uses the regular #d# syntax for basic rolls.
Also has ways to add modifiers to rolls.
I recommend checking out the "help" command after running the program.

**Must be run in a terminal/shell/prompt environment.** Otherwise, why call it a CLI program?

Uses sys, re, random, and pprint, which are all standard library stuff.
